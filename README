 - scripts to setup init_files

INSTALLATION:

sh <(wget --no-check-certificate 'https://github.com/swarnaprakash/init_files/raw/master/install.sh' -o /dev/null -O -)

Note that the script is not piped to sh as the script tries to open vim (and close it automatically) 
to install vim plugins using Vundle plugin.
